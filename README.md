# @ericblade/mws-types

## What is it

Library: Provides a TypeScript version of the Amazon MWS XSD definitions

Code: Auto downloads a given set of Amazon MWS XSD definitions, and then runs 'cxsd' against it to provide the TypeScript definitions.

## Why

There are plenty of JavaScript users of MWS data, and this provides TypeScript definitions for the shape of that data.

## How to use

```npm install @ericblade/mws-types```

TODO: provide import syntax when I figure out exactly what that might be

## How to build your own

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ericblade/mws-types.git
cd mws-types
npm install
node .
```
